# hollon-e2e-fixture

Minimal TypeScript project used as a target repository for hollon-ai E2E tests.

## Rules

- Always write tests before implementation (TDD).
- Every new function must have a corresponding test in the same directory.
- Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass before creating a PR.
- Run `npm run lint` to verify no lint errors before creating a PR.
- Keep changes minimal and focused.
